The company OSEDAX Dariusz Merta has received support for the project: *“Implementation of proprietary weld quality control solutions for the production of high-quality steel supports intended for the railroad industry and ski lift structures”*.

The innovative production technology will be based on the use of the proprietary concept of welding area verification on posts intended for ropeways, which is related to the exposure of these posts to changing weather conditions, vibrations, as well as difficult access during operation.

The project will include tasks related to the purchase of machinery and equipment, which will be necessary to perform welding analysis on posts and other welded elements, and are necessary for the introduction of new products to the company's offer: improved supports for steel structures for ropeways, as well as a new technical analysis service: weld quality control.

The result of the project will be a product innovation in the form of a significantly improved product - steel supports for ropeways, which will be implemented through the introduction of a new production process. The new support structures will be marked by weather resistance, high strength and extended lifetime.

Implementation of the project will provide direct recipients of the result of the project, a high-quality product in the form of ropeway supports, which are a key element ensuring the safety, reliability and durability of the entire transport system. Thanks to the implementation of innovative products to the company's offer, the applicant will be able to compete effectively in terms of quality, will increase its production capacity, will expand its range of products, and thus the circle of its customers.
